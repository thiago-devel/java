## Selection Sort
This algorithm needs a helper function in order to discover what's the minor item in the selection item list that will be sorted. This algorithm needs to interact with all items of the list that will be sorted. The performance of this algorithm it's not the best between the sort algorithms.

## Insertion Sort
This algorithm performs the sort during the iteration of the list items. During the iteration, it checks if the previous (left item) is minor then the current case true, it changes the positions of the items.

## Merge Sort
This algorithm is able to take pre-sorted item lists and merge them into a new one in a sorted way.
